create the plan for this task and then send it to employer. Employer can accept or can discard the plan. Then, during employee's work he or she (employee)
should put the checkmark near the plan item which they have done. Employer can aslo approve or not this action. Each employer
has a unique code which leads to the chat of people, who only have this code. Direct messages could be send to people who have the same code as you.
